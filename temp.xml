<title>Setup</title>
<simpara>Vagrant requires requires either VirtualBox, VMWare or any other
hypervisor virtualization. In our case, we&#8217;ll use VirtuaBox. The
installation process is (a) install VirtualBox then (b) install
Vagrant.</simpara>
<simpara>There are a couple of ways to install these software. It depends on
your operating system and what kind of package manager you are using.
OSX has HomeBrew and MacPorts, Linux has aptitude, rpm, yum etc. and
Windows has chocolatey.</simpara>
<simpara>The most straightforward way is to install
virtualbox and vagrant using pre-compiled binaries. The process
involves nothing more than downloading these binaries, double-clicking
them and following the wizards. Just like how you would install any
other app in your system.</simpara>
<section xml:id="_osx">
<title>OSX</title>
<screen>brew update
brew tap caskroom/cask
brew install brew-cask
brew cask install vagrant virtualbox</screen>

<screen>sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade
sudo -apt-get install vagrant virtualbox-dkms</screen>
</section>
<section xml:id="_windows">
<title>Windows</title>
<simpara>You can install either (a) install binaries for both vagrant and
virtualbox or (b) you can get them via the chocolatey/nuget package
manager.</simpara>
<simpara>To install using precompiled binaries:</simpara>

<chapter xml:id="_vagrant_boxes">
<title>Vagrant Boxes</title>
<simpara>Working with vagrant almost always means working on the command line.
You really need to be comfortable working on a terminal window.
Invoking  the vagrant command shows a help file which also lists the
most common commands like box, init, destroy, halt etc. Most of these
commands though have their own sub-commands. It could be confusing at
first but as you work with vagrant and get familiar with it, you&#8217;ll
find that the commands (and sub-commands) are structured quite
sensibly.</simpara>
<simpara>Let&#8217;s try out our first command.</simpara>
<screen>vagrant box list</screen>
<simpara>The command above will show you all the boxes you already have
downloaded in your machine.  Nothing will show up if you have just
installed vagrant,  so let&#8217;s get our first box.</simpara>
<note>
<simpara>A box is some sort of an operating system image. If you have
performed complete disk backups of your operating system before, a box
is similar to that. It is a snapshot of an operating system. Snapshots
are taken and saved typically because you would like to restore them
at a later time, either on the same hardware or a different one.</simpara>
</note>
<section xml:id="_adding_a_boxes">
<title>Adding a boxes</title>
<simpara>To get an existing box, we&#8217;ll use the vagrant box add command. The structure of
that command looks like the one below</simpara>
<screen>vagrant box add [what you want to call it] [url of box]</screen>
<simpara>So, for our first box, we&#8217;ll get a 32 bit ubuntu box, we will call it
precise32.</simpara>

<simpara>A vagrant box is not the same as a vagrant project. Remember that a
box is just an image of the operating system. You can create many
projects using the same image. But we will need a box before we can
create project.</simpara>
<simpara>You can use the precise32 box we downloaded earlier for multiple
projects. This is actually one of the main use cases for vagrant. You
can isolate the libraries and configurations of your projects. That
way, you always have a clean baseline box.</simpara>
<simpara>To create our first project, we need to do (a) create a folder for our
project (b) run <literal>vagrant init</literal> inside the project folder and (c) edit
the vagrant file if we want to alter some of the default settings of
vagrant</simpara>

you might be wondering why we don&#8217;t see the usual window of
virtualbox. Vagrant, by default runs in headless mode that is why we
don&#8217;t see any GUI interfaces to it. You can work with the virtualbox
GUI if you really want (need) to, but working on the CLI is the
idiomatic way of working with vagrant.</simpara>

<simpara>Vagrant boxes tend to have a username named <emphasis>vagrant</emphasis> defined

involves (a) creating your desired username either via the <literal>useradd</literal>

<chapter xml:id="_vagrantfile">
<title>Vagrantfile</title>
<simpara><emphasis>Vagrantfile</emphasis> is a configuration file.  It was created when you issued
the command <literal>vagrant init</literal>. It&#8217;s written in the Ruby language, so it'
s very easy to read. There are a lot of defaults that
are already defined in this config file. You simply need to uncomment
them if you need to enable any particular functionality e.g. port
forwarding etc. The Vagrantfile has a simple structure, everything is
inside the <literal>Vagrant configure</literal> block. See the code example below</simpara>
<example>
<title>Vagrantfile</title>
<literallayout class="monospaced">Vagrant configure(2) do |config|
   # various configurations
end</literallayout>
</example>
<section xml:id="_port_forwarding">
<title>Port forwarding</title>
<simpara>Vagrant boxes are kind of insecure out of the box. That&#8217;s why the
<emphasis>public_network</emphasis> setting is commented by default. Think of it this
way, a computer on a private network is usually behind a firewall
and/or a router. Most computers on an office setting belong to this
category. Your office workstation is not reachable from the internet
because because it is behind a router.</simpara>
<simpara>When you create a vagrant project, the vm is on a private network.
That means you cannot reach any of its ports from the host machine,
unless you define a public network. Having a vm that is not accessible
from your host machine is not very useful, so we need a way to reach
the applications running on the vm. One way to do it via port
forwarding. Basically, we will map a port number on the host machine
to a port of on the guest machine (your vm). That way, when we try to
communicate to a port on the host machine, that request will be
forwarded to the port of the guest machine, thus making the services
of the guest machine reachable.</simpara>
<example>
<title>port forwarding configuration</title>
<literallayout class="monospaced">config.vm.network "forwarded_port", guest:80,  host:8080, id: "whatever" <co xml:id="CO5-1"/><co xml:id="CO5-2"/><co xml:id="CO5-3"/></literallayout>
</example>
<calloutlist>
<callout arearefs="CO5-1">
<para><literal>guest:80</literal>. The vm will listen on port 80, this is usually a web
server like Apache or NGinx or any other webserver that you want to
use</para>
</callout>
<callout arearefs="CO5-2">
<para><literal>host:8080</literal>. This is the port on the host machine (your actual PC
where the vagrant is installed). When you launch a browser and go to
<link xl:href="http://localhost:8080">http://localhost:8080</link>, you are actually hitting the port 80 of your vm</para>
</callout>
<callout arearefs="CO5-3">
<para><literal>id: whatever</literal>. This is optional, but it is always a good idea to
to put an id on your port mapping definition</para>
</callout>
</calloutlist>
<simpara>You can forward more than one port. If you need to open more ports on
the guest machine, just define each mapping on its line</simpara>
<example>
<title>forwarding more than one port</title>
<literallayout class="monospaced">config.vm.network "forwarded_port", guest:80,  host:8080, id: "apache"
config.vm.network "forwarded_port", guest:4000,  host:3000, id: "node"</literallayout>
</example>

</chapter>
<chapter xml:id="_networking">
<title>Networking</title>
<simpara>One of the common reasons why we run vagrant boxes is so that we can
run server applications in them, either for testing or for
development or something else. No matter what the reasons are why you
setup vagrant, you will need a way to access the servers that are
running on your guest machine. There are three ways to do this (1)
setup your vm as a public network (2) set it up as private network and
lastly (3) use port forwarding. Each of these options have their
advantages and disadvantages. Your general security situation and
project goals will largely determine which approach is right for you.</simpara>
<section xml:id="_public_networking">
<title>Public networking</title>
<simpara>This is known as <emphasis>bridge</emphasis> networking. If you go for this setup, the
guest computer, your vm, will actually appear as another node in the
current network segment. It will appear as another computer in your
network neighborhood.</simpara>

<textobject><phrase>public network</phrase></textobject>
</mediaobject>
</figure>
<simpara>We&#8217;ll look at two ways</simpara>
<tip>
<simpara>In a public network, you may be able to refer to your guest
machine via its hostname because your DNS server might be able to pick
up the hostname of the vm when the DHCP server gives it an IP address.
But not when you assign a static IP address</simpara>
</tip>
<example>
<title>Vagrantfile for public networking, static ip</title>
<literallayout class="monospaced">Vagrant.configure(2) do |config|
   config.vm.network "public_network", ip: "192.168.1.210"
end</literallayout>
</example>
<simpara>This type of configuration will boot up your machine and assign itself
a static IP address of 192.168.1.210. It will appear as another node
in the network segment.</simpara>
<warning>
<simpara>Consult your network administrator if it is okay to use any
specific IP addresses. Most network admins configure the workstation
endpoints to get their IP addresses dynamically from a DHCP server</simpara>
</warning>
<example>
<title>Vagrantfile for public networking, dynamic ip</title>
<literallayout class="monospaced">Vagrant.configure(2) do |config|
   config.vm.network "public_network", type: "dhcp"
end</literallayout>
</example>
<simpara>In this type of configuration, the guest machine will act like it is
another node of the network segment. It will listen to any DHCP
broadcast, if it finds any, it will fetch an IP address from the
server.</simpara>
</section>
<section xml:id="_private_networking">
<title>Private networking</title>
<simpara>When you setup your guest machine as a private network, it will only
be accessible from the host machine. No other machine in your network
can reach it. This is probably the safest and most secure usage of a
vagrant box</simpara>
<figure>

</section>
<section xml:id="_port_forwarding_2">
<title>Port forwarding</title>
<simpara>Private networking works best if you only need to access the vm from
the host. However, there are situations when you need other machines
in your network to gain access to the vm. Before you go to public
networking, you might want to consider port forwarding because it is
possible to let other machines gain access to the vm without totally
exposing the guest machine. Think of the port forwarding option as a
combination of public and private networking. We get to select which
application services (ports) we will expose to the public. The ports
are not <emphasis role="strong">all</emphasis> exposed as a default.</simpara>
