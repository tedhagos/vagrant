== Vagrantfile

_Vagrantfile_ is a configuration file.  It was created when you issued
the command `vagrant init`. It's written in the Ruby language, so it'
s very easy to read. There are a lot of defaults that
are already defined in this config file. You simply need to uncomment
them if you need to enable any particular functionality e.g. port
forwarding etc. The Vagrantfile has a simple structure, everything is
inside the `Vagrant configure` block. See the code example below

.Vagrantfile
====
....
Vagrant configure(2) do |config|
   # various configurations
end
....

=== Port forwarding

.Snippet for port forwarding

<3> `id: whatever`
