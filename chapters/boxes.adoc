== Vagrant Boxes

Working with vagrant almost always means working on the command line.
You really need to be comfortable working on a terminal window.
Invoking  the vagrant command shows a help file which also lists the
most common commands like box, init, destroy, halt etc. Most of these
commands though have their own sub-commands. It could be confusing at
first but as you work with vagrant and get familiar with it, you'll
find that the commands (and sub-commands) are structured quite
sensibly.  

Let's try out our first command.

----
vagrant box list
----

The command above will show you all the boxes you already have
downloaded in your machine.  Nothing will show up if you have just
installed vagrant,  so let's get our first box.

NOTE: A box is some sort of an operating system image. If you have
performed complete disk backups of your operating system before, a box
is similar to that. It is a snapshot of an operating system. Snapshots
are taken and saved typically because you would like to restore them
at a later time, either on the same hardware or a different one.

=== Adding a boxes

To get an existing box, we'll use the vagrant box add command. The structure of
that command looks like the one below

----
vagrant box add [what you want to call it] [url of box]
----  

So, for our first box, we'll get a 32 bit ubuntu box, we will call it
precise32.

----
vagrant box add precise32 http://files.vagrantup.com/precise32.box

=== Where to get vagrant boxes

Vagrant boxes are really just image files, so you can get it from any
where  or anyone who makes their vagrant boxes available. Be careful
when getting boxes from the internnet, make sure the site is
reputable. Having said that, here are two popular sites that makes
vagrant boxes available 

- http://files.vagrantup.com
- http://vagrantbox.es

=== Deleting and Renaming Boxes

When you longer need the OS image, you can delete the boxes in order
to free up disk space. By the way, vagrant boxes are located in (a)
`~/.vagrant.d/boxes` on macOS and Linux and (b)
`%USERHOME%\.vagrant.d\boxes` on Windows machines.
