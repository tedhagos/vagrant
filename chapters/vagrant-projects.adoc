== Vagrant Projects

A vagrant box is not the same as a vagrant project. Remember that a
box is just an image of the operating system. You can create many
projects using the same image. But we will need a box before we can
create project.  

You can use the precise32 box we downloaded earlier for multiple
projects. This is actually one of the main use cases for vagrant. You
can isolate the libraries and configurations of your projects. That
way, you always have a clean baseline box. 

To create our first project, we need to do (a) create a folder for our
project (b) run `vagrant init` inside the project folder and (c) edit
the vagrant file if we want to alter some of the default settings of
vagrant

.Creating a project
....
mkdir ~/vms/myproject && cd ~/vms/myproject
vagrant init precise32 # <1>
....
<1> This will create a file aptly named `Vagrantfile` on the folder
where the vagrant init command was ran. For now, we will simply use
the default Vagrant file. We will customize that file in later
sections

=== Start, Suspend, Resume, Stop and Destroy

Start the vagrant project, we need to (a) switch to the vagrant
project folder and (b) start the VM with the vagrant up command

.Starting a vagrant project
....
cd ~/vms/myproject && vagrant up
....

TIP: If you are used to working with virtualbox and any other hypervisor,
you might be wondering why we don't see the usual window of
virtualbox. Vagrant, by default runs in headless mode that is why we
don't see any GUI interfaces to it. You can work with the virtualbox
GUI if you really want (need) to, but working on the CLI is the
idiomatic way of working with vagrant.



.Managing vagrant boxes
....
vagrant suspend  # <1>
vagrant resume # <2>
vagrant halt # <3> 
vagrant destroy # <4>
....
<1> Puts the machine to sleep mode
<2> Wake up from suspend
<3> Graceful shutdown
<4> This is like `halt`, but it also destroys the VM itself

[NOTE]
.Turning the GUI on
====
If you still want to see the GUI of the virtualbox session, you
can do the following

1. Exit the existing virtual machine session, if you are in one
2. Edit the Vagrantfile configuration
3. Look for the config.vm.provider entry and uncomment that section
4. Reload the virtual machine using the command vagrant reload
====




=== Getting into your box

Start the VM if it isn't already started, then login to the virtual
machine using `vagrant ssh`

....
cd ~/vms/myproject && vagrant up # <1>
vagrant ssh <2>
....
<1> cd to the vagrant project and invoke `vagrant up` to boot the
machine
<2> use ssh to login to your machine

NOTE: If you would like to use another ssh client such as PuTTy, you
may. Login to your machine via PuTTy using *username*=_vagrant_
*password*=_vagrant_
