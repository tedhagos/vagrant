== Networking

One of the common reasons why we run vagrant boxes is so that we can
run server applications in them, either for testing or for
development or something else.


=== Public networking

This is known as _bridge_ networking. If you go for this setup, the
guest computer, your vm, will actually appear as another node in the
current network segment. It will appear as another computer in your
network neighborhood.

.Vagrantfile for public networking, static ip
====
....
Vagrant.configure(2) do |config|
   config.vm.network "public_network", ip: "192.168.1.210" 
end
....
====
This type of configuration will boot up your machine and assign itself
a static IP address of 192.168.1.210. It will appear as another node
in the network segment.

WARNING: Consult your network administrator if it is okay to use any
specific IP addresses. Most network admins configure the workstation
endpoints to get their IP addresses dynamically from a DHCP server


.Vagrantfile for public networking, dynamic ip
====
....
Vagrant.configure(2) do |config|
   config.vm.network "public_network", type: "dhcp" 
end
....
====
In this type of configuration, the guest machine will act like it is
another node of the network segment. It will listen to any DHCP
broadcast, if it finds any, it will fetch an IP address from the
server.
