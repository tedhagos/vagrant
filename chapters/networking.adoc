== Networking

One of the common reasons why we run vagrant boxes is so that we can
run server applications in them, either for testing or for
development or something else. No matter what the reasons are why you
setup vagrant, you will need a way to access the servers that are
running on your guest machine. There are three ways to do this (1)
setup your vm as a public network (2) set it up as private network and
lastly (3) use port forwarding. Each of these options have their
advantages and disadvantages. Your general security situation and
project goals will largely determine which approach is right for you.

=== Public networking

This is known as _bridge_ networking. If you go for this setup, the
guest computer, your vm, will actually appear as another node in the
current network segment. It will appear as another computer in your
network neighborhood.

We'll look at two ways 

TIP: In a public network, you may be able to refer to your guest
machine via its hostname because your DNS server might be able to pick
up the hostname of the vm when the DHCP server gives it an IP address.
But not when you assign a static IP address


.Vagrantfile for public networking, static ip
====
....
Vagrant.configure(2) do |config|
   config.vm.network "public_network", ip: "192.168.1.210" 
end
....
====
This type of configuration will boot up your machine and assign itself
a static IP address of 192.168.1.210. It will appear as another node
in the network segment.

WARNING: Consult your network administrator if it is okay to use any
specific IP addresses. Most network admins configure the workstation
endpoints to get their IP addresses dynamically from a DHCP server


.Vagrantfile for public networking, dynamic ip
====
....
Vagrant.configure(2) do |config|
   config.vm.network "public_network", type: "dhcp" 
end
....
====
In this type of configuration, the guest machine will act like it is
another node of the network segment. It will listen to any DHCP
broadcast, if it finds any, it will fetch an IP address from the
server.

=== Private networking

When you setup your guest machine as a private network, it will only
be accessible from the host machine. No other machine in your network
can reach it. This is probably the safest and most secure usage of a
vagrant box

=== Port forwarding

Private networking works best if you only need to access the vm from
the host. However, there are situations when you need other machines
in your network to gain access to the vm. Before you go to public
networking, you might want to consider port forwarding because it is
possible to let other machines gain access to the vm without totally
exposing the guest machine. Think of the port forwarding option as a
combination of public and private networking. We get to select which
application services (ports) we will expose to the public. The ports
are not *all* exposed as a default.
